## Overview

AuditReady addresses one of the most common problems in regulated audits:

evidence exists, but it is scattered, poorly versioned, and hard to demonstrate when it matters.

The project provides a structured operational workspace to collect, version, and link evidence to DORA and NIS2 controls, ensuring traceability without introducing heavy platforms or unrealistic compliance claims.

AuditReady **does not certify compliance**.

It helps teams demonstrate what has actually been implemented.

## Highlights

* Control-based evidence collection

  * Immutable document versioning


  * Control status tracking (Missing / In review / Completed)


  * Ownership and responsibility mapping


  * Exportable audit packs (ZIP/PDF with index and changelog)


  * Third-party evidence request support



## Notes

AuditReady is currently in beta and focuses on:

* speed of use
* workflow clarity
* repeatable audit processes

The functional scope is intentionally limited to ensure reliability, security, and adoption in regulated environments.
