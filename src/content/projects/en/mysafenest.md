## Overview

MySafeNest is a product concept designed to help households coordinate safety routines with minimal friction. It combines smart notifications, shared “I’m safe” check-ins, and an admin-friendly dashboard to manage who gets alerted and when.

## Highlights

- Smart alert rules (quiet hours, escalation, trusted contacts)
- Shared check-ins for family members
- Privacy-first approach (data minimization + encrypted storage)

## Roadmap

Near term: onboarding improvements, alert customization, and accessibility refinements.
